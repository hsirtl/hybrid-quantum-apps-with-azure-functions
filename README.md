# Hybrid Quantum Applications with Azure Functions

Quantum computers harness the unique behavior of quantum physics and apply it to computing. This approach promises massive speedup in compute time compared to classical computing, especially in areas like optimization, simulation, or machine learning. However, quantum computing components have a different operating model compared to classical software. There are typically one or more classical compute components that orchestrate the execution of quantum components. Azure Functions are one option for implementing these classical parts.

This project shows how they provide an easy way for exposing quantum functionality via APIs making it easy to create hybrid quantum applications.
